        Draft, then polish. When you draft, it is still crucial to get right the key details. At the end of the day, both design and writing are ways to communicate. The utmost is to stay faithful to the meaning. For communication clarity is important, and there are rules to guarantee it. Unclear design, as well as unclear speech, can become dangerous. “Language is politics,” so is design.

        Let’s begin with the sense of flow that is known to both designers and writers. At the beginning of a new project—be it a poster, website, or book—one need not be interrupted by polishing and petty work, trying to create something big all at once. For instance, a lot of writers recommend making no corrections until you are finishing, whether a poem or a chapter of a book.Yet there’s more to writing and design than this. Essentially, there are two phases of both writing and designing: (1) draft and (2) polish. After the whole thing is roughly assembled in a flash of inspiration, you must take a break, change the pace, and refine the details.

          “Write freely and as rapidly as possible and throw the whole thing on paper. Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down. Rewrite in process is usually found to be an excuse for not going on. It also interferes with flow and rhythm which can only come from a kind of unconscious association with the material.” — John Steinbeck, writer. A letter to his friend Robert Wallsten, 1948
          
          “Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning—and then edit it.” — David Ogilvy, founder of advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. How to Write, 1982
          
          “When it’s time to work again, always start by reading what you’ve written so far. The best way is to read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along, then go on from where you stopped the day before. When it gets so long that you can’t do this every day read back two or three chapters each day; then each week read it all from the start. That’s how you make it all of one piece.” — Ernest Hemingway, writer. Esquire article, 1935
