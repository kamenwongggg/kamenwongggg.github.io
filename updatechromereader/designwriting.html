      How I became a better designer through writing

        Have you ever thought to yourself I’m a designer, not a writer, I don’t need to write?
      </div>
    
      <div class="small">
        I used to think that way. Anytime I had to write, I would rush through it because I thought that writing wasn’t a skill that designers needed. I would rationalize my lack of writing skills by telling myself that designers designed, they didn’t write, after all my designs would speak for themselves.
        Wow, was I wrong!

          As a result, my work suffered because I couldn’t communicate my ideas in a clear and organized way either through writing or by talking about them. This caused me to have little influence within my team or with my clients. Once I realized the errors of my ways I began paying attention to my writing. I started writing with an intention to keep improving and using it as a tool in my design toolbox.
          <br><br>
          Today I want to share a few ways writing has helped me become a better designer. I will also include resources such as books, podcasts, and apps which I use to help me improve my writing skills.

          Writing is designing with words. It is a tool for designers to energize, inspire, and influence people to take action. By carefully selecting the words, I can make sure my message is received exactly as I intended it. On the other hand, when my writing is rushed through with lousy grammar, unorganized thoughts, and careless punctuation, it only adds confusion to the message. It opens the door for others to misunderstand and dilute my message. Good writing is crucial in getting my message across clearly and with impact.

          Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go. - E. L. Doctorow. Designers write every day to communicate and influence. It is crucial that you write clearly and concisely to get your message across and move your ideas forward. Having a good idea isn’t enough though. You need to be able to sell your ideas through written communication. Some opportunities for designers to write are: email communication, blog posts, UX writing, design research, design presentations, documentation. Every opportunity to write is an opportunity to improve your writing. Here are some ways writing has helped me become a better designer. I have also included some exercises to help you practice each part.
