        Spite fence is a term used in property law in some countries to refer to an overly tall fence or a row of trees, bushes, or hedges, constructed or planted between adjacent lots by a property owner, who is <a href="spitehousepage.html">annoyed</a> with or wishes to annoy a neighbor, or who wishes to completely obstruct the view between lots. Several U.S. states and local governments have regulations to prohibit spite fences, or related regulations such as those establishing a maximum allowed height for fences. In the <a href="index.html">United Kingdom</a>, the terms spite wall or blinder wall are more commonly used.
        <br><br>
        An overly tall fence may not be considered a spite fence by a court if there is some other reason for the fence which requires the extra height. In one case, a man built a 13-foot (4.0 m) fence on his property, and his neighbor sued him. The man had put up a fence that tall because his neighbor kept throwing garbage over the old fence. Since keeping garbage out of one's yard is a legitimate reason to have a fence, it was found not to be a spite fence.
