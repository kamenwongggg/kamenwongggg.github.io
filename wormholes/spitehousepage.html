      A spite house is a building constructed or substantially modified to irritate neighbors or any party with land stakes. Because long-term occupation is not the primary purpose of these houses, they frequently sport strange and impractical structures. Spite houses may create obstructions, such as blocking out light or blocking access to neighboring buildings, or they can be flagrant symbols of defiance. Although, <a href="index.html">in the US</a>, homeowners generally have no right to views, light, or air, neighbors can sue for a negative easement.

      In instances regarding a spite build, courts are far more likely to side with the neighboring parties which may have been affected by that build. This is partially attributable to the fact that modern building codes often prevent the construction of houses likely to impinge on neighbors' views or privacy, but mostly because fence construction is far cheaper, quicker, and easier than home construction. There are also similar structures known as <a href="spitefencepage.html">spite walls</a> or blinder walls.
