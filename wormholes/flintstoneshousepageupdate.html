      <div class="flinttext">
        This 2500-square-foot <a href="seashellhousepage.html">custom villa</a>, originally designed for TV personality Dick Clark, was modeled after the Bedrock home to blend in to its mountainous surroundings in the hills of <a href="index.html">Malibu</a>. However, it's not just the exterior—complete with private beach and beautiful views— that channels Fred and Wilma's stone age abode. The interior is filled with stone-like features from floor to ceiling—even furniture and a cleverly-cut window—that matches the cartoon. An all-stone master bath and bedroom filled with animal-like textiles gives even more of an all-natural look. Unfortunately a dinosaur garbage disposal, pet saber-tooth and woolly mammoth vacuum cleaner are not included.

      <div class="flintarchi">
        The interior of the Stone Age styled pad is linked to exterior beauty by way of large expanses of glass nestled in naturally irregular shaped surrounds, frameless and organic in appearance, through which the tantalising views of sea and mountain can be absorbed.
