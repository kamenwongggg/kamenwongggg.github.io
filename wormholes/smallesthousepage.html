        The minuscule home was created in the 16th century and remained in use until 1900, when the tenant was a 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m) fisherman named Robert Jones. The rooms were too small for him to stand up in fully and he was eventually forced to move out when the council declared the house unfit for human habitation, along with a number of properties. The house is still owned by his descendants, having been passed to female relatives since Robert's sons showed a lack of interest in the business. After some persuasion by the then editor of the North Wales Weekly News, Roger Dawson (the owner) and the editor toured the <a href="index.html">United Kingdom</a> in order to declare the house <a href="spitehousepage.html">the Smallest House</a> in Great Britain, a status that was later confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records.

        The Smallest House in Great Britain, also known as the Quay House, is a tourist attraction on the quay in Conwy, Wales. It is reputed to be smallest house in the United Kingdom.The house has a floor area of 3.05 by 1.8 metres (10.0 by 5.9 ft) and is painted red. It stands near the Conwy Castle walls. The ground floor is devoted to the living area with room for coal and an open fire, and a water tap tucked behind the stairs. The upstairs holds the cramped bedroom, which also comes with a small niche for storage.
